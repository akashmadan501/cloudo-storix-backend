# Cloudo-Storix – Architecture Overview

Cloudo-Storix is an API-first secure cloud storage backend built with a
phase-based architecture approach.

The goal of this project is not only to build features, but to understand
how backend systems evolve from local development to large-scale production
systems.

The system is intentionally developed in stages:
- Start simple and correct
- Identify scaling and operational pain points
- Introduce new technologies only when required

Each phase is documented to explain:
- Why certain architectural choices were made
- What problems they solve
- What limitations still exist

This repository represents both the code and the architectural thinking
behind Cloudo-Storix.
